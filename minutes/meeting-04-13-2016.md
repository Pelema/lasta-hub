# General Notes

Two aspects were discussed during the meeting:
1. Workflow of the curriculum development
2. Architecture of the application

## Curriculum Development Workflow

The following changes were recommended for the workflow:
- Market Survey should be changed to successful Needs Analysis
- No need to limit the consultation of the qualifications  
- QA should be replaced with QAU
- CTL should be replaced with TLU
- Centre of Cooperation Education (CCE) should also be included for undergrad programmes
- Internal discussion in the department before ready to submit to NQA, this is done so that it fits on the NQA template

It was noted that the roles and responsibility were not included in the workflow representation

## Architecture

The team should provide feedback on the proposed architecture by April 16th 2016.

## Recomendattions

Dr Colen Tuandu to provide a codification for all documents generated during the curriculum development

## Implementation

In priority all first three layers must  be deployed/implemented. The workflow engine as a micro service must be implemented first
Two teams were formed:

- UI Team: @Nashandi (fcsi), @fscidrjere, @nabot
- WF engine Team: @joque, @hkandjimi, @pmaoneke
